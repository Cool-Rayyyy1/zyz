I am a third-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Brandeis University, advised by [Professor Pengyu Hong](https://www.cs.brandeis.edu/~hong/). My research interests are in **generative AI for real-world applications** — building models that are efficient, effective, and explainable. Recently I’ve been focusing on **controllable diffusion** and **multimodal learning**, especially on improving inference and efficiency strategies for **stable, steerable text-to-image synthesis**.

Before Brandeis, I received my B.S. from the **University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign (UIUC)** and my M.S. from **Columbia University**.

Outside research, I enjoy working out, cooking, making cocktails, and traveling.
